# Packet-Tracer-Activity-Generator

This is a short script using xdotool and Cisco Packet Tracer (Instructor Version) to open .pka activity files and generate unique excercise for every student we have in a semester. Our goal is to force students to solve their own lab activites instead of just copying someone else's solution. With this tool you can hide a "flag" in the congratulation message, so when the student successfully finish the lab, he can upload the flag to a web page prooving he is done with it.
